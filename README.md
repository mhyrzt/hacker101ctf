i'm going to put my solutions (with some help from internet ofcourse xD) here, i hope you found them useful :D

## A little something to get you started

view the page source and look at the `<style>` section, haaa gocchaa!!
```html
<style>
    body {
        background-image: url("background.png");
    }
</style>
```
append `background.png` to the URL (`<someID>.ctf.hacker101.com/background.png`) and suprisingly it's not a image :D
